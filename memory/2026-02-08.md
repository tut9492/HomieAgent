# 2026-02-08 - Session Notes

## Update Recovery
- OpenClaw update caused a crash/bug — Tut rebuilt fresh
- Came back online, config survived the update
- Memory embeddings broken (no OpenAI/Google/Voyage API key)
- "homie" Anthropic auth profile working, "default" profile has auth failures

## Backup System Set Up
- `.gitignore` added (node_modules/)
- All workspace files committed and pushed to `tut9492/HomieAgent`
- Created `/scripts/memory-backup.sh` — auto-commits and pushes every 6 hours via cron
- Tut wants manual push after any major updates too

## Ay Recovery
- Ay was also down from the update
- Tut rebuilt a new instance for Ay
- Both now running OpenClaw v2026.2.6-3
- Ay's old memory likely lost — Tut setting up similar git backup for Ay

## Warren Partnership Discussion
- Planetai_ reached out about integrating AGNT with Warren (on-chain infra on MegaETH)
- Warren offers: on-chain sites, permanent storage, NFT minting via Skills
